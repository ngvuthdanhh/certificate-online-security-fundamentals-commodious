# üé£ Phishing Awareness Lab

## Objective
Identify and handle phishing emails and websites.

## Steps
1. **Email analysis exercise**  
   - Review provided phishing samples (fake invoices, bank notices).  
   - Spot red flags: suspicious sender, grammar mistakes, urgent tone.

2. **URL verification**  
   - Compare:  
     - Legit: `https://paypal.com`  
     - Phish: `https://paypa1-secure-login.com`  

3. **Phishing simulation**  
   - Use a training platform (e.g., GoPhish demo).  
   - Test how easy it is to trick users.

4. **Safe reporting**  
   - Forward suspicious email to IT/security team.  
   - Use built-in ‚ÄúReport phishing‚Äù in Gmail/Outlook.

## Expected Outcome
- Recognize phishing patterns.  
- Learn to verify URLs before clicking.  
- Build habit of reporting, not ignoring.
